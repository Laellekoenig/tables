Rules for this project:

- All styling must be done using tailwind.
- Always use cursor-pointer for buttons
- Do not use one-line if statements, always use {} and at least three lines
- The components in /ui are shadcn components based on base ui
- Do not use standard ts error handling where possible. Use neverthrow instead and create safe wrapped versions of used library functions.
- When HTML elements are on same indentation level, leave empty line between them for better readability
- Helper functions are below the main export functions in the code

Assume the dev server is already running.
Never run build or dev.
Never run db:generate or db:push.
Use tsc to check if project compiles.
Always run npm run format after changing files.
