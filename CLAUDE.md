Rules for this project:

- All styling must be done using tailwind.
- Always use cursor-pointer for buttons
- Do not use one-line if statements, always use {} and at least three lines
- The components in /ui are shadcn components based on base ui
- Do not use standard ts error handling where possible. Use neverthrow instead and create safe wrapped versions of used library functions.

Assume the dev server is already running.
Never run build or dev.
Never run db:generate or db:push.
Use tsc to check if project compiles.
